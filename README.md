## AIM OF THE PROJECT:
You are required to create a communication program in the form of a client and a server. 
The server must be launched first and, after starting, should display its PID. 
The client takes two parameters:
- The PID of the server.
- A string to transmit.

The client must communicate the provided string to the server. 
Once the server has received the entire string, it must display it. 
The server should display the string quickly. If you feel the process is too slow, it probably is. 
The server must be able to receive strings from multiple clients consecutively without needing to be restarted. 
Communication between your programs must be performed exclusively using UNIX signals. 
You may only use the two signals: SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2.
### BONUS
The list of possible bonus features includes:
- The server confirms the reception of each message by sending a signal to the client.
- Support for Unicode characters.

## ARCHITECTURE:
- mandatory/ directory for the mandatory part:
    - include/ directory for header files
    - src/ directory for the src files:
        - client/ directory for the client files
        - server/ directory for the server files
- bonus/ directory for the bonus part
    - include/ directory for header files
    - src/ directory for the src files:
        - client/ directory for the client files
        - server/ directory for the server files
- Makefile (with rules: make server_only client_only bonus clean fclean re):
- libft/ directory with my own library (standard functions, ft_printf, get_next_line)
- readme.md for explanations and main commands of the project

## SOME COMMANDS YOU CAN USE:

compile both server and client without bonus:

	make

compile only the server:
 
	make server_only


compile only the client:

	make client_only

compile both server and cleint with bonus:

 	make bonus
  
launch the server, which remains waiting until CTRL + C to stop it:

the server must be launched before the client 
when the client sends a message to the server, the server writes the message sent 
(and sends a confirmation to the client for the bonus part)

	./server

launch the client:

the client sends <Your message> to the server which has the <server PID> PID 
(and then wait for a response from the server for the bonus part)

	./client <server PID> <"Your message">

send a unique signal to the server so that you can see what is happenin when the server cannot receive a complete message:

	 kill -SIGUSR1 <server PID>


## DOCUMENTATION:

### process
A process is a running instance of a program that is executed by the operating system. 
It includes the program's code, its current activity (such as variables and data), and system resources like memory and CPU time. 
Each process is identified by a unique Process ID (PID). 

### process id (PID)
PID (Process ID) is a unique identifier (a number) assigned by the operating system to each running process. 
It is used to manage and track processes within the system. 

### parent and child processes
A parent process is a process that creates one or more child processes.
It is the process that initiates another process by using system calls like fork().
The parent process can manage or communicate with its child processes, and the child processes inherit certain attributes from the parent,
such as the environment and open files.
For example, when you launch a program from a terminal, the terminal is the parent process and the program is its child process.
That child process can become the parent of another process if it launches another process by itself.

### init and systemd
The first process launched during the system startup on UNIX or Linux is usually init (in older systems) or systemd (in modern systems).
init is the parent process of all other processes on a UNIX or Linux system,
and it is the first process executed by the kernel after hardware initialization and root filesystem mounting.
In modern systems, systemd has replaced init and is also the first process executed after the kernel starts, with PID 1.
Both processes serve as system managers, responsible for initializing system services, managing processes, activating devices,
managing users, and other essential tasks to keep the system running.
In summary, the first process launched at startup is either init (in older systems) or systemd (in modern systems), and its PID is always 1.

### process stop
When a process stops (or terminates), several things happen:
- exit status:
  
	The process ends and returns an exit status to the operating system,
	typically indicating whether it finished successfully or encountered an error.
	This status can be checked by the parent process to determine how the child process ended.
- process termination:
  
	The operating system releases the resources (like memory, file descriptors, etc.) that were allocated to the process.
	The process is removed from the process table, which is a data structure that keeps track of all running processes.
- zombie state:
  
	If a process has terminated but its parent has not yet read its exit status (using a system call like wait()),
	the terminated process enters a "zombie" state.
	It still occupies a slot in the process table, but is effectively dead, awaiting cleanup by the parent.
	The parent process must call wait() to collect the exit status and remove the zombie process.
#### parent-child relationship:
Once the process terminates, the parent process may take specific actions, 
such as cleaning up after the child process or launching new processes. 
If the parent doesn't handle the termination of the child, 
the operating system may assign a new parent process (often init or systemd) to clean up.

### process state
In general, a process on a UNIX or Linux system can be in one of the following states:
- Running (R):
  
	The process is currently running or ready to run.
	It is using the CPU or waiting for its turn to use the CPU.
- Sleeping (S):
  
	The process is waiting for an event or a resource.
	It can be in an interruptible sleep, where it can be awakened by a signal or an event,
	or in an uninterruptible sleep, where it cannot be interrupted.
- Stopped (T):
  
	The process has been stopped, usually by a signal such as SIGSTOP or SIGTSTP.
	It can be restarted by a signal such as SIGCONT.

- Zombie (Z):
  
	The process has finished execution, but its entry in the process table has not yet been removed.
	This occurs when the parent process has not yet read the exit status of the child process.
- Dead (D):
  
	The process is in an uninterruptible sleep state, usually waiting for an I/O operation.
	This state is rarely observed and is often related to hardware issues or device lockups.

### signal
A signal in computing is a mechanism used to notify a process about an event or interrupt its execution.
It is a form of inter-process communication in UNIX-like systems.
Signals can be generated by the kernel or other processes to notify a process of events
such as errors, the need to terminate, or the occurrence of certain conditions.
Common signals include SIGINT (interrupt), SIGKILL (force termination), and SIGTERM (graceful termination).
Processes can handle signals by either performing a default action or executing a custom signal handler.

### common signals
Hereâ€™s a list of common signals in UNIX-like systems, along with their associated numbers.
In the context of the minitalk project, the only signal allowed are SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2
- SIGINT: Interrupt signal, associated with number 2.
It interrupts a running process. It is typically sent when a user presses Ctrl+C in the terminal.
- SIGKILL: Force termination signal, associated with number 9.
It immediately kills the process and cannot be caught or ignored.
- SIGTERM: Termination signal, associated with number 15.
It is a polite request for the process to terminate, which can be handled or ignored by the process.
SIGTERM is often expected to allow for a more orderly shutdown than SIGINT.
- SIGQUIT: Quit signal, associated with number 3.
Similar to SIGINT, but it also causes the process to create a core dump.
- SIGHUP: Hang-up signal, associated with number 1.
Often sent to a process when its controlling terminal is closed, typically used to indicate that a process should reload its configuration.
- SIGUSR1: User-defined signal 1, associated with number 10.
It can be used by processes for custom actions.
- SIGUSR2: User-defined signal 2, associated with number 12.
Like SIGUSR1, it is for custom purposes.
- SIGSTOP: Stop signal, associated with number 19.
It pauses a process, and it cannot be caught or ignored.
- SIGCONT: Continue signal, associated with number 18.
It resumes a process that was previously stopped.
- SIGSEGV: Segmentation fault signal, associated with number 11.
It is generated when a process tries to access an invalid memory location, often indicating a bug in the program.

### SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2
SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 are user-defined signals in Unix-like systems that can be used for custom actions within a program.
Since they have no default behavior, developers can define how the program should respond to these signals, such as
triggering logging, reloading configurations, or toggling debugging modes.
These signals are useful for inter-process communication and controlling a program's behavior during runtime without terminating it.
Programs can handle SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 signals by setting up custom signal handlers using functions like signal() or sigaction().
When received, the program executes the corresponding handler,
such as (for example) logging an event for SIGUSR1 or running a diagnostic routine for SIGUSR2.

### getpid()
#include <unistd.h>

pid_t getpid(void);

The getpid() function in C retrieves the Process ID (PID) of the calling process,
which is a unique identifier assigned by the operating system.
It returns a value of type pid_t and is commonly used for process management, debugging, and inter-process communication
(e.g., sending signals using kill()).
In multithreaded programs, all threads share the same PID.
The function is often paired with getppid() to determine the parent process's PID
or used after fork() to differentiate between parent and child processes.
The PID remains unique while the process is active, but it can be reused after the process terminates.

### kill()
#include <signal.h>

int kill(pid_t pid, int sig);

The kill() function in C is used to send a signal to a specific process or a group of processes.
It takes two parameters: the pid (process ID) of the target process and the signal to be sent (e.g., SIGTERM, SIGKILL, SIGINT).
The function returns 0 on success or -1 on error.
It can be used to control processes, such as terminating them or sending various signals like interrupting or stopping them.
kill() is versatile and not limited to just terminating processes; it allows sending any signal defined in the system.

### pause()
#include <signal.h>

int pause(void);

The pause() function in C suspends the execution of a program until a signal is received.
It doesn't take any parameters and returns -1 when a signal interrupts the function call, setting errno to EINTR.
The function is commonly used in programs that need to wait for a signal (like SIGINT) before resuming execution.
Once the signal is received, the program resumes execution after handling the signal.

### sleep()
#include <unistd.h>

unsigned int sleep(unsigned int seconds);

The sleep() function in C is used to pause the execution of a program for a specified number of seconds.
It takes one argument, the number of seconds to sleep, and suspends the process for that duration.
The function returns 0 if the sleep duration is completed, or the remaining number of seconds if the sleep was interrupted by a signal.
sleep() is commonly used to introduce delays or pauses in a program without consuming CPU resources, allowing the system to perform other tasks.

### usleep()
#include <unistd.h>

int usleep(useconds_t microseconds);

The usleep() function in C suspends the execution of a program for a specified number of microseconds (1 second = 1,000,000 microseconds).
It takes an argument, the number of microseconds to sleep, and returns 0 if the sleep duration is completed successfully, or -1 in case of an error.
usleep() is typically used when shorter delays than one second are needed, such as in applications requiring high precision or brief pauses.
However, it may not be highly accurate due to the way the operating system handles timing and other concurrent processes.
For more precise delays, nanosleep() is often preferred.

### signal()
#include <signal.h>

void (*signal(int signum, void (*handler)(int)))(int);

The signal function in C is used to associate a specific signal (like SIGINT for interrupt or SIGTERM for termination)
with a custom handler function. This handler is executed when the process receives the signal.
The function takes two arguments: the signal number (signum) and a pointer to the handler function,
which must follow the prototype:

**void handler(int);**

Alternatively, you can use SIG_IGN to ignore the signal or SIG_DFL to restore its default behavior.
If the program enters other functions or threads,
the signal handler remains valid unless overridden by another signal() or sigaction() call.
If you call signal(signum, ...) again within the program, it will overwrite the previous handler.
You can restore the default behavior using signal(signum, SIG_DFL).

 **Limitations:** While signal is simple to use, it has limitations, such as platform-dependent behavior and potential issues with reentrancy.
For better portability and finer control over signal handling, the modern alternative sigaction is recommended.
Some signals, like SIGKILL and SIGSTOP, cannot be caught or ignored, as they are managed exclusively by the operating system.

### sigaction()
#include <signal.h>

int sigaction(int signum, const struct sigaction *act, struct sigaction *oldact);

The sigaction() function in C is used to define a signal handler for specific signals,
providing more control and flexibility compared to the older signal() function.
It allows you to specify a handler function, a set of signals to block while the handler is executing, and various options through the sigaction structure.
It is part of the POSIX standard and is preferred for modern applications due to its ability to handle signals in a more reliable and consistent manner.
By using sigaction(), you can manage how your program responds to different signals,
ensuring proper handling of asynchronous events such as interrupts, terminations, and other system signals.
sigaction() returns 0 on success and -1 on error, and sets errno to indicate the error.

### sigaction structure
The sigaction structure in C is used to define how a program handles specific signals.
The structure includes several members:
- sa_handler:

	A pointer to a function that handles the signal,
	(or a set to SIG_IGN to ignore the signal or SIG_DFL to restore the default behavior for the signal).
	This function takes an integer argument representing the signal number.
- sa_sigaction:

	A pointer to an advanced signal handling function that can provide additional information about the signal.
	This is used when the SA_SIGINFO flag is set in sa_flags.
- sa_mask:

	A sigset_t variable that specifies a set of signals to be blocked while the signal handler is executing.
	This helps prevent other signals from interrupting the handler.
- sa_flags:

	An integer that specifies options for signal handling,
	such as SA_RESTART to restart interrupted system calls or SA_SIGINFO to use the sa_sigaction handler.
- sa_restorer:

	Reserved for future use and generally ignored.
 
By using the sigaction structure, you can manage how your program responds to different signals,
ensuring proper handling of asynchronous events such as interrupts, terminations, and other system signals.
This structure is part of the POSIX standard.

### sa_flags in the sigaction structure
The sa_flags field in the sigaction structure specifies options for signal handling. Here are the main flags you can use:

- SA_NOCLDSTOP:
  
	Prevents the sending of SIGCHLD when child processes stop or resume.
	Useful for ignoring notifications of child process state changes.
- SA_NOCLDWAIT:

	Indicates that child processes should not become zombie processes when they terminate.
	The system automatically reaps terminated child processes without requiring a wait() call.
- SA_NODEFER:

	Does not block the signal that triggered the handler during the execution of the handler.
	By default, the signal that triggered the handler is blocked during its execution.
- SA_ONSTACK:

	Uses an alternate signal stack specified by sigaltstack() for executing the signal handler.
	Useful for handling signals when the main stack is full or corrupted.
- SA_RESETHAND:

	Resets the signal handler to its default action (SIG_DFL) after the handler is executed.
	The signal handler will only be executed once.
- SA_RESTART:

	Restarts interrupted system calls instead of failing with EINTR.
	Useful for avoiding EINTR errors during certain system calls.
- SA_SIGINFO:

	Uses the sa_sigaction handler instead of sa_handler.
	Provides additional information about the signal via a siginfo_t structure.

### sa_sigaction
void handler(int signum, siginfo_t *info, void *context);

The sa_sigaction handler in the sigaction structure is used to define an advanced signal handler
that can provide additional information about the signal received.
This handler is activated when the SA_SIGINFO flag is set in the sa_flags field of the sigaction structure.
Using the sa_sigaction handler allows for more detailed and flexible signal handling,
enabling the program to access and respond to specific information about the signal and its source.
This can be particularly useful for debugging, logging, and handling complex signal interactions.

- signum:

	The signal number that was received.
- info:

	A pointer to a siginfo_t structure that contains additional information about the signal,
	such as the PID of the sending process, the UID of the sending user, and other relevant data.
- context:

	A pointer to a ucontext_t structure that provides the context of the process when the signal was delivered,
	which is rarely used in typical applications.

When using sigaction with the SA_SIGINFO flag, the sa_sigaction signal handler automatically receives the arguments signum, info, and context.
You do not need to explicitly pass these arguments;
they are provided by the system when the signal is received.
By properly configuring the sigaction structure, you can handle signals and access the additional information provided by the siginfo_t structure.	

### siginfo_t structure
The siginfo_t structure in C provides detailed information about a signal that was received.
It is used in conjunction with the sa_sigaction handler when the SA_SIGINFO flag is set in the sigaction structure.
Using the siginfo_t structure allows for more detailed and flexible signal handling,
enabling the program to access and respond to specific information about the signal and its source.
This can be particularly useful for debugging, logging, and handling complex signal interactions.
The siginfo_t structure includes various fields that describe the signal and its context:
- si_signo:

	The signal number that was received.
- si_errno:

	An error number associated with the signal, if applicable.
- si_code:

	A code that provides additional information about why the signal was generated.
- si_pid:

	The process ID of the sending process.
- si_uid:

	The real user ID of the sending process.
- si_addr:

	The address at which a fault occurred (for hardware-generated signals like SIGSEGV).
- si_status:

	The exit value or signal (for SIGCHLD).
- si_band:

	Band event (for SIGPOLL).
- si_value:

	Signal value (for real-time signals).

### sigemptystet()
#include <signal.h>

int sigemptyset(sigset_t *set);

The sigemptyset() function in C is used to initialize a signal set to be empty, meaning it removes all signals from the set.
This function is often used in conjunction with other signal handling functions to configure signal masks.
To use sigemptyset():
- first declare a sigset_t variable
- then call sigemptyset() with a pointer to this variable
This prepares the signal set for further manipulation, such as adding specific signals with sigaddset().
By initializing the set to be empty, you ensure that only the signals you explicitly add will be included in the set,
allowing for precise control over which signals are blocked or handled in your program.
sigemptyset() returns 0 on success and -1 on error, and sets errno to indicate the error.

### sigset_t
The sigset_t type in C is used to represent a set of signals.
It is defined in the <signal.h> header and is used for manipulating signal sets in various signal handling functions.
Functions such as sigemptyset(), sigfillset(), sigaddset(), sigdelset(), and sigismember() operate on sigset_t variables
to initialize, add, remove, and check for signals within the set.
If you declare a variable of type sigset_t but do not initialize it with sigemptyset() or another initialization function like sigfillset(),
the contents of this variable will be undefined.
This means that the signal set could contain random values, which can lead to unpredictable behavior when you try to manipulate or use this signal set.

### sigaddset()
#include <signal.h>

int sigaddset(sigset_t *set, int signum);

The sigaddset() function in C is used to add a specific signal to a signal set (sigset_t).
This function is typically used in conjunction with other signal handling functions to configure which signals should be blocked or handled.
To use sigaddset():
- first initialize a sigset_t variable (often with sigemptyset() to start with an empty set)
- then call sigaddset() with a pointer to this variable and the signal number you want to add
By adding signals to the set, you can precisely control which signals are included, allowing for effective signal management in your program.
sigaddset() returns 0 on success and -1 on error, and sets errno to indicate the error.
